## Description ##

This is a web application that provies the user with a calories counter.
The way the app works is the user is asked a few questions that are necesary to determine the amount of calories his body consumes per day.
Each value is stored in a variable that is later going to be use in the final calculation.

If the user does not fill any required input, he is not going to be able to calculate the calories. He is going to be promted until he fills all inputs.

After all inputs are filled or the required cheboxes checked, the calculte button will do the work.
If the inputs are not filled the user is going to see an alert. This alert is going to tell the user to fill all the inputs so the button "calculate" proceeds to realize all the necesary calculations
This button will use all the values that the user wrote or selected applying them to the calories calculation formula, that will give the result.
Each sex has its own determined formula.
